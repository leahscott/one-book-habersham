				<p>All around the country for the last decade people have been coming together to build community through stories. Habersham County has joined this national movement with One Book Habersham. Each year people throughout Habersham County Georgia are invited to read and share the same picture book.</p>
				<p>In 2015, the inaugural year, thousands of people read and discussed Carmen Agra Deedy's <em>Martina the Beautiful Cockroache</em>. In March of 2015 Ms. Deedy spent three days at three elementary schools sharing her amazing storytelling gift. Hundred of adults and children were able to enjoy her stories at a public event. That evening created the opportunity for people to come together and share their stories with people they had never know before.</p>
				<p>The second year's book is Lester Laminack's <em>Three Hens and a Peacock</em>&mdash;a colorful, crazy book on the</p>

				<p>theme of accepting our own gifts. Mr. Laminack will be in Habersham County for two days in April. See the Events page for more details on the author visit as well as various smaller gatherings that will be happening throughout the county in February and March.</p>
				<p>Books will be available at all public libraries and schools throughout the community for you to read, enjoy, and share with others.</p>
				<p>One Book Habersham is a community partnership between the Habersham County School System, Volunteers for Literacy, Habersham County Libraries and Piedmont College with support from local businesses and organizations. We invite you to join in this fun approach to building community and promoting literacy in Habersham County.</p>

			This year's book:
			<strong>Three Hens and<br>a Peacock</strong>

			<div class="book-summary">
				<p>Laminack and Cole's hilarious book reveals what happens when some foolish farm animals decide to trade roles-and discover just how hard it is to do someone else's job.</p>
				<p>The Tuckers' farm is a peaceful place: cows chew their cud, hens lay their eggs, and the old hound rests on the porch. Everyone has a job and no one complains. That is, until a hapless peacock suddenly falls off the back of a passing truck and stirs things up.</p>
				<p>Soon, customers are flocking to the farm to see what all the fuss is about, and business is booming. But the hens don't like the newcomer getting attention while they stay cooped up doing all the hard work. The wise old hound sees the problem and helps his feathered friends orchestrate a job swap. What follows is the hilarious tale of three hens who get in way over their feathered heads, and one very distressed peacock who just can't figure out how to lay an egg.</p>
				<p>Popular author Lester L. Laminack has created a comical look at what happens when we underestimate the value of others' work. Henry Cole's delightful illustrations heighten the story's humor and will have readers of all ages laughing out loud.</p>
